# project (week 2)
# tittle: authentication system using all the things we have learned so far

# project breakdown
# requirements
# feature 1
# 1. loop (while loop infinite (show the ui and input boxes so that user can input values like username and password))
# 2. input data
#   2.1: user enters correct password
#      message: login success!!
#   2.1: user enters wrong password
#      message: please enter right password
#      next step: show that input box which is in the first step to make sure user can reenter the password

# feature 2
# 1. user should be able to create an accout and with that account he/she will be able to login later
# 2. after creation login flow will be same as step one
# 3. optional: make sure there is some special characters and caps letter small letter and digits in the password
# 4. optional: lets assume we will use gmail account as username so there should be @gmail.com at the end of the string

# tools to use
# 1. while loop
# 2. dict to store the email and password in memory
# 3. switch cases (to make ui for user so that user can choose from multiple options)
# 4. if/else statement to compare cases if entered password and usernames are valid of not
# 5. variables to store the user data
# 6. break to get out of the application (conditional, if user chooses to break out of the application)
# 7. contine to skip the current loop in case we dont want to execute further code, ex: if user enters the wrong password then we will print the message and continue the loop
# 8. user functions to properly divide the code so that we can reuse that in multiple places
